# HANDWRITTEN DIGITS DATASET

## Summary
A dataset containing 120 samples of handwritten digits. The quality and characteristic of each sample may vary depending on how my team member did it, however, all samples strictly followed the rules:
- Digits are written on an A4 paper with a white background.
- Digits must be in black/blue color.
- Digits must be in the center of the picture and near the edges as much as possible.
- Allow zooming in when taking picture, but using any third-party apps to crop/resize picture.
