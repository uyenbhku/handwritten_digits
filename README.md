# Dataset of Handwritten Digits

## Overview
This dataset comprises 120 samples of handwritten digits. The quality and characteristics of each sample may differ depending on the team member who created it, but all samples strictly adhere to the following guidelines:
- Digits are written on an A4 paper with a white background.
- Digits are in black or blue color.
- Digits are centered and as close to the edges as possible.
- Each picture is in its original size and contains only one digit.
- Zooming in is allowed when taking the picture, but using any third-party apps to crop or resize the picture is prohibited.
- Have no specific requirements on lighting conditions, but they must be sufficient to see the digit clearly with naked eyes.
- There are no restrictions on pen point size, image ratio, image size or camera quality.
